# 🧨 Baselinepy.ro Resurrection Log  
### Christopher Ruckman — Backend Revival Tour  
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Location:** Tiltonsville, OH  
**Environment:** Windows 11 + Git Bash + PowerShell + Python 3.13.7  
---

## 🎸 Act I: Python Ghosts & Broken Paths

- Tried launching `python -m venv venv`  
- Got hit with:  
  `Fatal Python error: Failed to import encodings module`  
- Diagnosis: Microsoft Store Python stub haunting the shell  
- Fixes:
  - Uninstalled all Python versions
  - Deleted leftover folders and cleaned system PATH
  - Reinstalled Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3137/)
  - Verified with `where python` and `python --version`

---

## ⚡ Act II: Virtual Environment Rebirth

- Nuked broken `.venv` with `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv`  
- Recreated with `python -m venv .venv`  
- Activated via PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Verified activation with (.venv) prompt

🔥 Act III: Dependency Drop & Stack Lockdown
Ran one-shot install:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Confirmed with pip list:

FastAPI, Uvicorn, Cloudinary, SQLModel, Pytest, Dotenv, Multipart, Httpx, and more

Verified with pip check and manual imports

☁️ Act IV: Cloudinary Crash & Comeback
Uvicorn failed with: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cloudinary'

Installed Cloudinary SDK:

bash
pip install cloudinary
Relaunched backend with:

bash
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
🎭 Act V: Shell Swaps & Syntax Slams
Tried source .venv/Scripts/activate in PowerShell

Got CommandNotFoundException — PowerShell doesn’t speak Bash

Realized: Already inside venv, no need to activate again

Swapped between Git Bash, CMD, and PowerShell like a command-line ninja

🚀 Final Status
Backend stack verified and running

All dependencies installed

Virtual environment clean and activated

Uvicorn serving FastAPI like a metal anthem

## 🎶 Database Riff Recap — Oct 1, 2025 @ 3:01 PM EDT

Backend nearly complete. Database tables riffing in harmony:
- `tabs`, `users`, `parsing_results`, `logs` all structured
- Foreign keys and relational integrity next on deck
- Planning for analytics, tagging, and community features

Status: Schema solid. Ready to expand and connect frontend.
